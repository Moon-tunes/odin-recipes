# odin-recipes

The purpose of this project is to practice my HTML skills by creating a basic website that holds recipe information.

This project will test my ability to set up HTML pages, create and format text in a basic way (without CSS), add images and link to other web pages.

After creating the lasagne recipe page, there was no need to flesh out the pie or cheesecake pages in great detail. Then again, pie is the superior of the three so it may need more attention.
